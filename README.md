Project Description: Forecasting Covid-19 Cases Using Facebook Prophet

In this project, we aim to forecast Covid-19 cases for the next 30 days using Python and the Facebook Prophet model. The project involves the following steps:

Data Preparation:

Combine and clean the existing datasets to create a unified dataset.
Ensure the data is formatted correctly with columns for dates and case counts.
Data Visualization:

Geographic Visualization: Display the global spread of Covid-19 on a geographic map to understand how cases are distributed across different regions.
Daily Cases Visualization: Analyze the daily number of Covid-19 cases worldwide to observe trends and fluctuations over time.
Daily Deaths Visualization: Examine the daily Covid-19 death cases globally to analyze patterns and trends in mortality rates.
Forecasting with Facebook Prophet:

Use the Facebook Prophet model to predict Covid-19 cases for the next 30 days. Prophet is a robust time series forecasting tool designed to handle seasonal effects and trends.
Implement the model in Python, fit it to the historical data, and generate forecasts to anticipate future trends in Covid-19 case counts.
By leveraging these techniques, the project aims to provide actionable insights into the future trajectory of the Covid-19 pandemic, helping in planning and response efforts.
